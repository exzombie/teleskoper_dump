# TELESKOPER

This is a dump of an old project I did at university to learn assembly
programming for PIC micros. I published it here mainly so I don't lose it. It
works, so feel free to use it. It reads the position of a joystick and prints
commands to serial port in order to move an LX200 telescope mount. It can be
easily extended to print other commands, but it cannot receive responses, so it
can't be easily extended to support, for example, NextStar mounts. After I did
this, we switched to NextStar mostly, and Arduino happened, so I never polished
this project. The schematic is simple and code is commented, so it may be
useful in the future. I can't be bothered to provide step-by-step instructions.
More details are in the attached report, but not in English I'm afraid.
